                All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?<br>
                We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br>
                Have with our needles created both one flower,<br>
                Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br>
                Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br>
                As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds<br>
                Had been incorporate. So we grew together<br>
                Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br>
                But yet an union in partition,<br>
                Two lovely berries molded on one stem:<br>
                So with two seeming bodies but one heart,<br>
                Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<br>
                Due but to one, and crownèd with one crest.<br>
                And will you rent our ancient love asunder,<br>
                To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br>
                It is not friendly; ’tis not maidenly.<br>
                Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>
                Though I alone do feel the injury.<br>
