    <h3>The Block Journey</h3>
    <p>
        From the dark,
        <br>
        fewer neglected neon signs.
        <br>
        More open stores.
        <br>
        I had survived the block journey
        again,
        <br>
        and my pale face regained its color.
    </p>

    <h3>Flicked</h3>
    <p>
        “Look up, bitch.”
        <br>
        I looked up.
        <br>
        Somebody had flicked my side.
        <br>
        Just a glimpse
        <br>
        of the figure,
        <br>
        in the dark.
        <br>
        On a dark street.
        <br>
        What?
        <br>
        I kept walking.
    </p>

    <h3>Piercing White</h3>
    <p>
        “Five dolla, five dolla, five dolla.”
        <br>
        The ground is wet.
        <br>
        It's dark out.
        <br>
        He sits on that wet, dark sidewalk.
        <br>
        Piercing white hydrangeas glisten beside him,
        <br>
        waiting to be loved,
        <br>
        but only a cardboard sign will keep them company.
        <br>
        I walk briskly past,
        <br>
        for five dollars is too much to pay.

    <h3>Rotary of Words</h3>
    <p>
        In a rut of empty
        <br>
        filler words.
        <br>
        “Just kidding.”
        <br>
        “I know.”
        <br>
        “You know.”
        <br>
        “I'm not.”
        <br>
        I turn the rotary,
        <br>
        “Right?”
        <br>
        not from zero to nine,
        <br>
        but because there's comfort in agreement,
        <br>
        repetition.
        <br>
        No awkward silences
        <br>
        to take over the looming,
        <br>
        empty
        <br>
        space.
    </p>
