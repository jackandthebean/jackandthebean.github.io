    <p>This place was bustling, and the food was good. The tsukemen ramen was better seasoned than the tonkotsu, and the gyoza could have been crispier. I don’t know if they hadn’t been fried for long enough, or if the sake they poured on top made the dumplings soggy, but otherwise the ginger flavor was great!</p>
