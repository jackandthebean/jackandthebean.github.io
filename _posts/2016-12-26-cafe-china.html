    <p>Michelin rated Café China deserves both its star and its hype, but come prepared to wait for a table if you plan on sampling their delicious Sichuan cuisine. Bustling with people and bubbling with chatter, the space is quite cozy; dated Shanghai posters lining the yellowing, pale blue walls add to the charm of the interior.</p>
    <p>It does not take long for our orders to arrive, and I dig right into the slippery and gelatinous spicy beef tendon. Sichuan peppercorn and chili oil develop an eccentric yet pleasant tingling sensation in my mouth, and I can’t help but want another bite. Our waiter returns quickly; he is carrying the eggplant in garlic sauce and Chungking braised fish stew. The stew is piping hot, and the eggplant is seasoned to satisfaction. I serve myself some of the tender fillets of tilapia that are swimming alongside bean sprouts and soft tofu in a spicy, red broth, flavored with chili oil. Each bite fulfills my craving for good Chinese food.</p>
