    <p>I usually travel to Sweden in the summers, to visit my family friends, during which time they live in southern Sweden (Båstad, Skåne). Visiting during the fall meant I had a new opportunity to explore Stockholm, where they live during the work/school year. Stockholm is known for its subway station art, some of which is pictured below. Rosendals Trädgård remains my favorite place in Stockholm, though Bergianska Trädgården was quite beautiful.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 1.5em">8 Hours in Copenhagen</h1>
    <p>After some time in Stockholm, I traveled down to Båstad. While down south, I spent one day in Copenhagen, Denmark—just two hours away by train. My phone plan didn’t extend to Denmark, so I had no service—just a long list of places to check out! It was exhilerating to know I had crossed international borders, with no way for anyone to reach me.</p>

    <p>For Thanksgiving, I met my mom in France, before heading back to Båstad for Christmas. As usual, we divided our time between Paris and Burgundy.</p>

    <h1>Luciakonsert</h1>
    <p>Swedish summers already had my heart, but the Swedish Christmas spirit is also unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Eagerness for <i>jul</i> warms the air, and string lights and advent candles everywhere ensure the short days are not dreary. <i>Luciakonsert</i>s—real children with real candles, singing real choral music, <i>lussekatter</i>—saffron buns, <i>Sveriges Televisions julkalender</i> and <i>Kalle Anka</i>, proper <i>julbord</i>s and <i>julmust</i>: a Swedish holiday season builds anticipation and excitement with traditions not only shared within families, but also in every household across the nation.</p>
