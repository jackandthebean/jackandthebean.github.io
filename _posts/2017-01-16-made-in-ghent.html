    <p>From day one, my mom has only ever exposed me to locally sourced, organically grown, seasonal produce, meats, and grains. I even used to own (and occasionally wear) a t-shirt printed with the words “locally grown” in bright, green letters; since I consume only local food items it seemed appropriate to also sport my own “local” label. Because of this upbringing, I share a soft spot with my mom for small-scale farms and food shops run by devoted artisans who have a true passion for making and/or curating quality food products. One such establishment bears the name “Made in Ghent”; we had heard talk of the place but what motivated us to visit were captivating Instagram posts, no less. Started by Mimi and Richard Beaven, initially New-York-City-to-Columbia-County weekenders, the couple decided to permanently leave the urban, in exchange for a more rural environment. Eventually they came across 75 acres of old farm land, and while all existing structures on the property were in dire need of replacement, they decided to pursue a project in farming/cooking for business. Funnily enough, the contractor we used to convert an old dairy barn into our home in Hillsdale is the same guy Mimi and Richard employed to do work on their property! Made in Ghent now comprises of a flourishing farm, kitchen, and store—quite an admirable feat for a pair of properly metropolitan individuals.</p>
    <p>On our first visit, my mom and I purchased a loaf of their sourdough bread, a carton of eggs, and one whole chicken. The bread made excellent toast, the chicken was tender and delicious, and the eggs were quite fluffy, though the yolks were not as yellow as those of the eggs we get from Sean Stanton of Blue Hill / North Plain Farm.</p>
    <p>Of course one should visit Made in Ghent to purchase the thoughtfully prepared goods they offer, but the grounds on their own are delightful as well. Modern, dark barn structures define the otherwise bare grass fields, and the kitchen and store prove elegantly endearing. The kitchen-store complex is separated by a walkway: to the left is where the refrigerated items reside, along with a white cupboard, ladder, and charming farm table; to the right is a black Dutch door that opens into a single room, housing both the kitchen and a magnificent table of beautiful, freshly baked goods. No barriers prevent customers from entering the kitchen, and the design of the room fosters a sense of simply being in someone else’s home kitchen. Sunlight floods all the installed windows, and Mimi and Richard’s hospitality is enthusiastic.</p>
