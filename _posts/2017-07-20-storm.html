    <h3>Storms, a Haiku</h3>
    <p>
        A storm on its way.
        <br>
        Mother storms about father.
        <br>
        I watch both unfold.
    </p>

    <h3>You Make Me Smile</h3>
    <p>
        Each word is given
        <br>
        only a brief check
        <br>
        before it falls
        <br>
        off your tongue—so raw,
        <br>
        but I struggle to be there too.
    </p>
    <h3>Greasy</h3>
    <p>
        Why are you like oil,
        <br>
        so hard to remove?
        <br>
        After one wash, the grease lingers—
        <br>
        the same after two.
    </p>
