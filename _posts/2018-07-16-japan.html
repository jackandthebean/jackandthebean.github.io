    <h1>有楽町</h1>
    <p>Our first night in Tokyo, in Yurakucho, a business district.</p>

    <h1>築地市場</h1>
    <p>Prior to having done any real research for this trip to Japan, if someone were to have asked me what I considered a must-visit in Tokyo, the Tsukiji fish market would definitely have been at the top of my list; it did not disappoint. The liveliness of the marketplace matched the footage I had seen, from various travel shows. In real life, it was larger and more intricate than I had imagined. Between broader rows of fresh seafood, produce, dried beans, and rice, there were endless narrow alleyways, filled with miniature restaurants and vendors. Deciding what tasty bite to sample first was an overwhelming task. Would it be the sizzling skewers of grilled octopus, fish cakes, giant oysters, sweet beans, or rolled egg omelets? I savored a bite of each, as well as an uni-ikura rice bowl. On leaving Tsukiji, the lingering taste of subtly-vinegared sushi rice, nose-stinging wasabi, briny urchin, and juicy roe reminded me that all I had seen and tried had not been a mere dream.</p>

    <h1>明治神宮</h1>
    <p>At Meiji Jingu, I first began to encounter Japan’s unique light. How does it fall through trees so starkly yet so softly?</p>

    <h1>京都</h1>
    <p>I love trains, and the Tokyo-to-Kyoto Shinkansen experience was no exception. I wish I could have a Japanese train-station-bento for lunch everyday. Pictured below is one of the most memorable meals I had in Japan, a full ryokan breakfast at Yoshida Sanso, in Kyoto.</p>

    <h1>嵐山</h1>
    <p>The Arashiyama Bamboo Forest is a quintessential Kyoto destination. I’d never seen bamboo like this, and the soft, magical Japanese light continued to prevail.</p>

    <h1>金閣寺</h1>
    <p>Another quintessential Kyoto destination, the Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavillion) was definitely shrouded in divine energy—it was both breathtaking and somewhat belittling.</p>

    <h1>서울</h1>
    <p>And the final leg of this trip to Asia was in Seoul, Korea, so we could spend time with family before returning to the States.</p>
