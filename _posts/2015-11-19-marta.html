    <p>Located within the Redbury Hotel, Marta is currently my favorite pizza place. It’s young. It’s modern. It’s cool. The executive chef is Maialino’s own Nick Anderer.</p>
    <p>Marta’s pizzas have thin, crispy crusts that contrast with the chewier pizza crusts we love so much in New York City. Pictured here are the <i>Suppli alla Terrazza</i>—green risotto croquettes with mozzarella and mixed herbs—and the stracciatella  and funghi pizzas. Like a margherita, the stracciatella pizza is composed of cheese made from buffalo’s milk, tomato sauce, and basil leaves. However, stracciatella differs from mozzarella in that, like burrata, it is creamier and softer, due to an additional shredding technique. Thus, unlike a classic margherita, the stracciatella pizza is topped with cheese only after having baked the pie first, to accentuate the stracciatella’s luxuriously creamy texture.</p>
    <p>The second pizza, the funghi, is my favorite at Marta. Topped with fontina, mozzarella, hen of the woods, chanterelles, red onion, and thyme, every mouthful has the perfect amount of cheese to complement the textured bite created by the assortment of mushrooms. If it’s truffle season and Marta is offering shaved truffle on top of their pizzas, definitely get it on the funghi. Check this restaurant out if you are looking for a good, casual place to eat!</p>
