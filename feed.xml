    &lt;h1&gt;Pepperland Aut 20&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 3em&quot;&gt;First apartment and first quarter of sophomore year&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;skinny_parallax airport&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 3em&quot;&gt;Moving is a notoriously time-consuming, tiresome affair, but setting up our new apartment took way longer than I expected. We found a lot of good stuff at a used hotel furniture store. The highlight of all the furniture thrift sifting and heavy lifting was acquring an onyx table for the kitchen and a lime green chair for feeling cool, modern, maybe even Scandinavian. Riding around in the back of a rental van like a dog, between shop stops, was the cherry-on-top of the practical-college-apartment assembly experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;two_imgs&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Valois&lt;/h1&gt;
            First year, I had never tried Valois, a Hyde Park brunch staple. This year, it was my apartment’s first meal out together. The food was not unlike most diner breakfasts, but, filled with devoted regulars and young college students, the ambiance was warmer and livelier than most.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;two_imgs&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/pepperland_aut_20/valois.JPG&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That evening, the apartment was christened with a dinner party. I served melon and proscuitto, caprese salad, more salad (greens), Wagyu Bohemian steaks, and cacio e pepe. Yeah, the menu was a bit eh, but I wanted to serve crowd-pleasers! We didn’t have enough chairs for everyone, but it was fine, because our big, ugly couch can seat a football team. Well, not really, but a coach would definitely have this couch in his basement den. He’d host a get-together and squeeze his team onto it, right before berating the season’s performance then toasting their hard work. It wouldn’t matter if team members got their shoes on the couch, because it would already be speckled with beer foam and have Dorito crumbs in the crevices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 style=&quot;margin-top: 3em&quot;&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lake is another thing I didn’t properly explore first year. Especially with this year’s remote learning, it was a great solace.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hyde Park Farmers Market&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matteo, Carson, and I decided to cook from produce offered at the Hyde Park Farmers Market. There, we bumped into our incredibly warm, recently-published, Canadian, ex-model, freshman resident head. Waiting in line for some squash, brushing away Chicago’s maturing autumn chill, we caught up for a while; we smiled goodbye. Back at the apartment, we made butternut squash gnocchi from scratch and baked a dish of ratatouille.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;B is for Becca&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;and for Bicycling through Brooklyn&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=&quot;accent&quot;&gt;Washington Sq Park&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Becca Ida Siegel is my best friend. Why do we always wind up at Washington Square Park? The people there are lively. They soak up the sun and songs of small musicians; they skate around in the fountain; they don’t marvel at the arch. New York City is not dead.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We Citi-biked across the Brooklyn Bridge to another park full of lively humans. Becca met my college friend Maggie. We shared some Coronas to forget about corona.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;It’s so strange. I know I should be sad, and I am, part of me is. But it’s like… it’s like I’m having the most beautiful dream… and the most terrible nightmare, all at once.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Learning Korean with new Japanese friends on college break&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cortados and non-soy alternative milks are hard to find in Seoul. Anthracite Coffee quickly became my favorite coffee shop; they serve well-made cortados and these adorable pound cakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/korea/anthracite_coffee_seoul.JPG&quot;&gt;

        &lt;img class=&quot;two_imgs&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/korea/seoul.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My time in Seoul quickly became defined by daily Korean classes at Yonsei University. Through the program, I befriended mainly Japanese students around my age, all of whom were on spring break from their respective universities. They had all chosen to spend their vacations learning and immersing themselves in Korean culture, primarily spurred by an obsession with K-pop music.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;홍대&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We celebrated the end of the first week of classes with some clubbing in Hongdae.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Though communication was limited with my new Japanese friends—neither of us spoke the other’s language, and our Korean was not good enough to bridge the gap, we made fond memories together over many delicious meals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

            Before we knew it, the Korean language program at Yonsei had ended, and it was time for all of my Japanese friends to go back home.
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;two_imgs&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/korea/graduation.JPG&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;北海道&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before heading back to the States, I visited Japan for the second time. This trip was very exciting, because I’ve been wanting to go to Hokkaido for the longest time. I hope to visit again when the lavender fields are in full bloom, and it’s not quite so cold.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Walking through Hell Valley, a “dramatic crater with boiling sulfuric hot springs, volcanic steam plumes and hiking paths,” made me recall the Great Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;My Gap Year Begins&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Maxing out time in the Schengen: Sweden, Denmark, and France&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually travel to Sweden in the summers, to visit my family friends, during which time they live in southern Sweden (Båstad, Skåne). Visiting during the fall meant I had a new opportunity to explore Stockholm, where they live during the work/school year. Stockholm is known for its subway station art, some of which is pictured below. Rosendals Trädgård remains my favorite place in Stockholm, though Bergianska Trädgården was quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After some time in Stockholm, I traveled down to Båstad. While down south, I spent one day in Copenhagen, Denmark, just two hours away by train. My phone plan didn’t extend to Denmark, so I had no service—just a long list of places to check out! It was exhilerating to know I had crossed international borders, with no way for anyone to reach me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For Thanksgiving, I met my mom in France, before heading back to Båstad for Christmas. As usual, we divided our time between Paris and Burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Luciakonsert&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swedish summers already had my heart, but the Swedish Christmas spirit is also unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Eagerness for &lt;i&gt;jul&lt;/i&gt; warms the air, and string lights and advent candles everywhere ensure the short days are not dreary. &lt;i&gt;Luciakonsert&lt;/i&gt;s—real children with real candles, singing real choral music, &lt;i&gt;lussekatter&lt;/i&gt;—saffron buns, &lt;i&gt;Sveriges Televisions julkalender&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kalle Anka&lt;/i&gt;, proper &lt;i&gt;julbord&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;julmust&lt;/i&gt;: a Swedish holiday season builds anticipation and excitement with traditions not only shared within families, but also in every household across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;07/16/2018&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My First Visit to Japan&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Tokyo, Kyoto, and a stop to see family in Seoul&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long-awaited high school graduation gift: my first trip to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as my mom and I boarded the taxi that would take us from the airport to our hotel, we sensed a trip unlike any other was upon us, despite our extensive travel repertoire. We were about to immerse ourselves in the richness of Japanese food and culture that we’d coveted our entire lives. But as we drove deeper and deeper into the heart of Tokyo proper, the unfamiliar alphabet spanning every sign in sight and the very real language barrier between us and our taxi driver emphasized how far from home we had flown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;有楽町&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After checking in and dropping off our bags at the hotel, we set out to explore the surrounding neighborhood—Yurakucho, a business district. The sun had finished setting. Men and women in suits flooded the sidewalks and sought after-work refuge among the innumerable bars and restaurants that lined each street. As New Yorkers, we were no strangers to seeing an abundance of restaurant businesses, but it seemed our city had met its match in Tokyo. After a light dinner, we rushed back to the hotel to sleep, in preparation for an early-morning excursion to the world-renowned Tsukiji fish market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/japan/chiyoda_ku_yurakucho.jpeg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;築地市場&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is plenty of quality sushi to be had in New York City, but ask any sushi chef where their most prized ingredients come from, and they’ll tell you. The Tsukiji fish market. On food and travel TV shows, I had seen footage of the market bustling with vendors, chefs, locals, tourists, and, of course, the whole gamut of edible sea creatures, but, in-person, it was larger and more intricate than I could possibly have imagined. Between broader rows of fresh seafood, produce, dried beans, and rice, there were endless narrow alleyways, stacked with boxy restaurants and smaller vendors of prepared food. Trying to decide which tasty bite to sample first was almost paralyzing. Would it be the sizzling skewers of grilled octopus, tender fish cakes, giant oysters, sweet beans, or rolled egg omelets? We savored bites of each of these offerings and closed with glistening uni-ikura rice bowls. On leaving Tsukiji, the tastes of subtly-vinegared sushi rice, nose-stinging wasabi, briny urchin, and succulent roe lingered on my tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;明治神宮&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout our trip to Japan, my mom and I visited a wealth of traditional temples. It was at Meiji Jingu that I first observed Japan’s unique light. At once soft and stark, it falls through tree branches in graceful streaks. If New York’s light is warmer—radiating and capable of penetrating asphalt, glass, and humid air, Japan’s light is cooler—nimble and gentle like the Greek moon goddess Selene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/japan/meiji_jingu_tokyo.jpeg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On that note, here’s a poem by Inuo Taguchi, translated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;side_padding&quot;&gt;
        &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin: 0&quot;&gt;
            The Trunk of Light&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            The tree, its trunk filled with light, is&lt;br&gt;
            a pillar that stands like a god&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            The tree is lush with love&lt;br&gt;
            tenderly sheltering a small bird&lt;br&gt;
            The tree casts a shadow of mercy&lt;br&gt;
            to harbor larvae harassed by the sunlight&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            The tree is totally absorbed in doing nothing&lt;br&gt;
            it has no time to rest&lt;br&gt;
            The tree accepts Heaven’s Will, so&lt;br&gt;
            it moves not even a step from where it stands&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            The tree, its trunk filled with light,&lt;br&gt;
            stands just like a god&lt;br&gt;
            Having drawn up tears from the Earth&lt;br&gt;
            all-encompassing light ever intensifies its glow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;京都&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a week of dining, sight-seeing, and shopping in Tokyo, we boarded the Shinkansen bullet to Kyoto. Of course, the bento boxes we purchased at Tokyo Station were beautifully arranged and delicious. I’m envious we have no elegant bento box equivalent for on-the-go meals in the US—and, for that matter, quality convenience store offerings that aren’t highly-processed health demons. I’m thinking of simple rice balls and the iconic Japanese egg salad sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Kyoto, we stayed at a traditional ryokan. The full Japanese breakfast pictured below was one of the most memorable meals from the whole trip: agedashi tofu swimming in a lightly sweet broth, grilled salmon, salty pickles, steamed rice, and hot tea. Each component was subtly flavored, thoughtfully prepared—the epitome of good Japanese cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Arashiyama Bamboo Forest is a quintessential Kyoto destination. Japan’s soft, magical light continued to prevail at Arashiyama.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;金閣寺&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another quintessential Kyoto destination, the Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavillion) seemed shrouded in divine energy. Though it was breathtaking, the sheer opulence of its golden walls was also belittling. It seemed that the slightest misstep would incur the wrath of a lurking Japanese demon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;서울&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, before returning home, my mom and I stopped in Seoul, Korea to spend time with family. After relaying our experiences in Tokyo and Kyoto to my grandparents and cousins, I was left most impressed with the food we had eaten and the beautiful light that had graced all that we’d seen. We’d only scratched the surface, and I was eager to return to Japan soon—I was already itching to visit Hokkaido, for its vast lavender fields and much-lauded dairy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above all, Japanese hospitality is unparalleled—engrained in the culture, and I don’t think one could reasonably go to Japan without coming away with a sort of regal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">07/16/2018 My First Visit to Japan Tokyo, Kyoto, and a stop to see family in Seoul The long-awaited high school graduation gift: my first trip to Japan. As soon as my mom and I boarded the taxi that would take us from the airport to our hotel, we sensed a trip unlike any other was upon us, despite our extensive travel repertoire. We were about to immerse ourselves in the richness of Japanese food and culture that we’d coveted our entire lives. But as we drove deeper and deeper into the heart of Tokyo proper, the unfamiliar alphabet spanning every sign in sight and the very real language barrier between us and our taxi driver emphasized how far from home we had flown. 有楽町 After checking in and dropping off our bags at the hotel, we set out to explore the surrounding neighborhood—Yurakucho, a business district. The sun had finished setting. Men and women in suits flooded the sidewalks and sought after-work refuge among the innumerable bars and restaurants that lined each street. As New Yorkers, we were no strangers to seeing an abundance of restaurant businesses, but it seemed our city had met its match in Tokyo. After a light dinner, we rushed back to the hotel to sleep, in preparation for an early-morning excursion to the world-renowned Tsukiji fish market. 築地市場 There is plenty of quality sushi to be had in New York City, but ask any sushi chef where their most prized ingredients come from, and they’ll tell you. The Tsukiji fish market. On food and travel TV shows, I had seen footage of the market bustling with vendors, chefs, locals, tourists, and, of course, the whole gamut of edible sea creatures, but, in-person, it was larger and more intricate than I could possibly have imagined. Between broader rows of fresh seafood, produce, dried beans, and rice, there were endless narrow alleyways, stacked with boxy restaurants and smaller vendors of prepared food. Trying to decide which tasty bite to sample first was almost paralyzing. Would it be the sizzling skewers of grilled octopus, tender fish cakes, giant oysters, sweet beans, or rolled egg omelets? We savored bites of each of these offerings and closed with glistening uni-ikura rice bowls. On leaving Tsukiji, the tastes of subtly-vinegared sushi rice, nose-stinging wasabi, briny urchin, and succulent roe lingered on my tongue. 明治神宮 Throughout our trip to Japan, my mom and I visited a wealth of traditional temples. It was at Meiji Jingu that I first observed Japan’s unique light. At once soft and stark, it falls through tree branches in graceful streaks. If New York’s light is warmer—radiating and capable of penetrating asphalt, glass, and humid air, Japan’s light is cooler—nimble and gentle like the Greek moon goddess Selene. On that note, here’s a poem by Inuo Taguchi, translated. The Trunk of Light The tree, its trunk filled with light, is a pillar that stands like a god The tree is lush with love tenderly sheltering a small bird The tree casts a shadow of mercy to harbor larvae harassed by the sunlight The tree is totally absorbed in doing nothing it has no time to rest The tree accepts Heaven’s Will, so it moves not even a step from where it stands The tree, its trunk filled with light, stands just like a god Having drawn up tears from the Earth all-encompassing light ever intensifies its glow 根津美術館 Nezu Garden 京都 After a week of dining, sight-seeing, and shopping in Tokyo, we boarded the Shinkansen bullet to Kyoto.
