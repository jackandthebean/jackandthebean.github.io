    <p>I’ve had too many blogs to count. Then I took them all down, because I felt lost. How could I have an online presence without a clear brand? Bombarded by branded content on social media, I felt pressed to find my own brand. I couldn’t, because I didn’t even know who I really was.</p>
    <p>Though I’m still figuring out who I am and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, I came to the freeing realization that I don’t have to question why I enjoy recording memories beautifully. Whether it’s delicious, homemade meals or good times with friends, photographing and arranging those experiences is satisfying and heartwarming for me. I suppose this blog is then just a digital scrapbook. If you’re reading this, I hope you can absorb even a fraction of the joy—or maybe even sorrow—that went into the memories I’ve recorded here.</p>
    <p>With genuine and warm affection,<br>Jackie</p>
