    <p>I have returned! I am so excited about the pictures in this post, because I used a new camera lens that has a much larger aperture than my previous lens. It captures light so beautifully!</p>
    <p>My mom made madeleines and steamed ramp and meat (a mixture of pork and beef) dumplings from scratch, so that’s what’s pictured above.</p>
